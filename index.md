# About Me

My name is Genny Korn, and I am an electromechanical engineer with a passion for designing and creating systems that not only function effectively but also spark curiosity in those that interact with them. I have a broad range of experience including, 2D and 3D modeling, instructional design, fabrication, quality control, teaching, mentoring, technical project management, equipment installation, and lab operations. Having recently relocated to the Albuquerque, NM area, I am excited to out down roots and inspire others to follow their interests and pursue their passions.

My experience in both industry and academia has given me a unique perspective on the different approaches each takes to project planning, communication, and problem solving. This experience has taught me how to bridge the gap between the two worlds and successfully execute projects of varying sizes and complexities while keeping all stake holders informed of progress. 

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, aerial acrobatics, fighting combat robots, and costuming.
