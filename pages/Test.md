Combat robotics is weight class based robotics competition in which teams design robots that fight to the death, incapacitation, or end of a timed round round, whichever comes first. Like in many traditional sports, the robots are divided into different weight classes typically ranging from Fairyweight robots (0.33lbs/0.15gk) up to Heavyweight and Alternative Heavy weight robots (220lbs/100kg or 250lbs/110kg respectively). Aside from matches where one of the competitors is destroyed or incapacitated, match winners are determined by judges that score each robot on a variety of catergories weighted, typically, aggression (3 points), control (3 points) , and damage (5 points).
