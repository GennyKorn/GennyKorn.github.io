## What is combat robotics?

Combat robotics is weight class based robotics competition in which teams design robots that fight to the death, incapacitation, or end of a timed round round, whichever comes first. Like in many traditional sports, the robots are divided into different weight classes typically ranging from Fairyweight robots (0.33lbs/0.15gk) up to Heavyweight and Alternative Heavy weight robots (220lbs/100kg or 250lbs/110kg respectively). Aside from matches where one of the competitors is destroyed or incapacitated, match winners are determined by judges that score each robot on a variety of catergories weighted, typically, aggression (3 points), control (3 points) , and damage (5 points).

## My Builder Philosophy

<div class="col-8", style="padding-left: 0px;">
<p>
Build something ridiculous and share the knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Every bot I have designed, I have looked for ways to cause passerbyes to do a double take and have kids yell "WHAT'S THAT?!". This often leads to more technical questions that are driven by curiosity and excitement from people that would otherwise not be interested in robotics. When something catches your eye, curiosity takes over and you want to learn more, even if the topic is somethng you know nothing about.
</p>
<p>
No one goes into combat robotics knowing exactly what they are doing. Even with a background in engineering, there is still a steep learning curve. Robots are using components in ways they were never designed for and pushing them to their limits. By sharing what we have learned and discovered with our respective bots, we are able to lower the barrier to entry and develop better, more destructive bots and more fun competitions.

## Competitions

The competitions that I have most often competed in are Robobrawl, a 30lb Feather Weight, competition, and Design. Print. Destroy. (DPD), a 3D printed 1lb Ant Weight competition. Both of these competitions take place at the University of Illinois and are run by students and draw in competitors of all levels.

When I was attending the University of Illinois, I helped create Design. Print. Destroy (DPD). This competitoin is unique in that it is exclusively a 3D printed competition meaning that the only parts of your robot that are allowed to be metal/other materials are you electronics, wheels, fasteners, and no more than 50% of your weapon. These rules were created intentionally to lower the financial and manufacturing barriers that often prevent people from creating robots in addition to creating a more approachable competition to less experienced builders. DPD has expanded from being just a competition to becoming the main event for Robot Day, an outreach event hosted by students for local kids and families to learn about engineering.

## 1 lb Robots (Antweight Class)

### Taste the Rainbow

Taste the Rainbow was a freeform spinner built entirely from scrap parts that otherwise would have gone in the trash. The robot is composed of failed 3D printed parts from other robots, waste ABS filament, electronics and screws recovered from destroyed robots, and the tape holding all of the electronics in which was used on a box to ship parts to our workshop.

I created this bot the night before the competition with only a 3Doodler pen in hand as a challenge to myself to see what I could create with only the parts that I had immediately on hand. In creating this bot, I sketched the base plate on a piece of paper and created the outline with a 3Doodler pen, I then used the pen effectively as a very weak ABS MIG welder to fill in the base plate with whatever fillament waste I had on hand. The variety of colors in the base plate is where the name is from as I thought it looked like a bunch of squished Skittles. Once the base plate was complete collected failed 3D printed parts and aligned them with the base plate and attached them again using the 3Doodler as an ABS MIG welder.
